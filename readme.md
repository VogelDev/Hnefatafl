# Hnefatafl
## Viking's Chess
I went to a viking exhibit at a local museum and they had a small version of this game. I looked into it a bit further for a complete rule set and decided I wanted to code my own version.

### Future Plans
#### To be crossed off as I do them:
- basic multiplayer
- Some sort of online multiplayer
- different board layouts and skins
- menus
- AI?

### Notes:
- I know a lot of this is sloppy. I typically code late at night, or have to frequently stop and pick up projects.
- I plan to do a full write up of the coding experience of this project, eventually

    - I've watched a lot of quill18created videos, but if I didn't watch this particular set, I probably wouldn't have tried to make this game.
